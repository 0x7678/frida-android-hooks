{"name":"Frida-android-hooks","tagline":"Instrument Everything ( Android )","body":"### Welcome to Firda- Hooks  ( Android )\r\nYou will find different different modules to hook various api calls in the android platform to conduct security analysis.\r\nRight now , we have the following modules :\r\n\r\n1. WebView loadUrl() : android.webkit.WebView\r\n    calls to webview is logged . \r\n\r\n2. getDeviceId() : android.telephony.TelephonyManager\r\n    detects if the above api is called and can return a fake device id if needed.\r\n\r\n3. isDebuggerConnected() : android.os.Debug\r\n    checks if a debugger is connected (JDB) to the app instance , can log and re-implement the method to fake it to the application which is being instrumented.\r\n\r\n4. .exists() : java.io.File\r\n    checks for the presence of files in disk , can log and even hide the presence of files from applications using this api.\r\n\r\n5. Root Bypass Re- Implementation : root.py\r\n    example on how a method could be re-implemented overriding the root-checks of an android application .\r\n\r\n\r\n### SetUp \r\n\r\nSetup :\r\n\r\n1 . Load Firda -server into your android device .\r\n\r\n    $ curl -O https://build.frida.re/frida/android/arm/bin/frida-server\r\n    $ adb push frida-server /data/local/tmp/\r\n    $ adb shell \"chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server\"\r\n    $ adb shell \"/data/local/tmp/frida-server &\" \r\n\r\n2 . Install frida on your machine .\r\n    easy_install frida\r\n\r\n3 . Change the package_name variable in the script to match the application you are instrumenting .\r\n\r\n4 . Run :\r\n    python hook_file_name_here.py\r\n\r\n5 . Run any app that uses the instrumented methods and check the module output .\r\n\r\nHave fun !\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n @antojoseph \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Scripts ?
